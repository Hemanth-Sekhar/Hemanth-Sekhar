## Hi there, I'm Hemanth Sekhar 👋

### Design Verification Engineer | SoC & System-Level Verification

Design Verification Engineer with 3+ years of experience in SoC functional verification, DFT-aware test flows, and silicon bring-up support. Strong ownership of debug, assertions, and coverage-driven verification with proven delivery across first-silicon milestones.

---

### What I do
- Own end-to-end functional verification of CPU, IO, system-resource and peripheral subsystems
- Develop and maintain robust testbench architectures using SystemVerilog and UVM
- Drive debug closure through waveform/log analysis and assertion-based observability
- Define feature-based test plans and achieve coverage-driven sign-off
- Collaborate with RTL and firmware teams to resolve functional issues and ensure design correctness

  Real-time, client-side RTL generator for APB, AHB-Lite and AXI4-Lite designs  
  - Synthesizable Verilog RTL
  - Register map editor with validation (Excel / YAML / JSON / IP-XACT)
  - Auto-generated SVA checks and minimal self-checking testbenches
  - Block diagram and memory map visualization

- **SiliconLadder** – https://siliconladder.com  
  A structured learning and interview-preparation platform for VLSI and DV engineers  
  - Curated roadmaps for Verilog, SystemVerilog, UVM and protocols
